The Rolling Stones -- Doom and Gloom

I had a dream last night that I was pilot in a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top

What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

All I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the light, your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me

Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Bowing to the rich and you worrying about the poor
Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors

What's that funky noise
It's the tightening of the screws
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go boom, boom, boom
Through that night, your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me
Yeah!
Baby won't you dance with me
Ah yeah

Fracking deep for oil but there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking at the garbage dump
I'm running out of water, so I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober, but I end up drunk

We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Gonna make your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt
Yeah

But all I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the night, your face I see
Baby, take your chance
Won't you dance with me
Yeah, come on

Baby won't you dance with me
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby won't you dance with me
Ah yeah!
Sitting in the dirt
Baby won't you dance with me
