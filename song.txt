The Rolling Stones -- Doom and Gloom

I had a dream last night that I was pilot in a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top

What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt

All I hear is doom and gloom
And all is darkness in my room
Through the light, your face I see
Baby take a chance
Baby won't you dance with me

Lost all that treasure in an overseas war
It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Bowing to the rich and you worrying about the poor
Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors

What's that funky noise
It's the tightening of the screws
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt
